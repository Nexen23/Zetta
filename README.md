(Created on summer 2013)

**Description**: collect coins avoiding spikes and flying vampire (rest NPCs are friendly). Use bombs to destroy walls and NPCs. Take care for you place highlighted on floor. Auto walls passing mechanics exists (e.g., you press Up and stuck at the wall. Passing mechanics will pass this wall left or right way (considering which is shorter) for you with corresponding animation)
